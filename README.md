# Introduction

> Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message
> or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message,
> image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

Where cryptography is the art of concealing messages from prying eyes, steganography
tries to hide the fact that a message was sent at all. Applications of steganography
range from [digital watermarking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking)
to securing communication channels.
