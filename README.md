# Introduction

> Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message
> or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message,
> image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

Where cryptography is the art of concealing messages from prying eyes, steganography
tries to hide the fact that a message was sent at all. Applications of steganography
range from [digital watermarking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking)
to securing communication channels.

# Overview

Chameleon is a collection of MATLAB scripts and functions that perform
steganographic operations. These tools allow users to hide and recover binary
files in and from images.

Why would anyone need something like that? Glad you asked!

One reasonable motivation is being able to feel like a hacker. Hide you PDF reports,
word documents or text files containing secret keys inside an image of a cute puppy
and send it to your friends! Have them clone this git repository and - *viola!* - you
have your own secret communication channel! Also, you can hide all sorts of stuff from
the FBI, though if you ever find yourself needing to do that please do not contact me...
